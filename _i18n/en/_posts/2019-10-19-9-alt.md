If Mínimo is laboratory of digital products, [ALT.](Https://alt.minimo.io) is its laboratory
of contents.

<hr>

In its [manifest](https://minimo.io/en/manifest/), Mínimo proposed to "spread good ideas".
It states, "We want to make stuff. We want to spread the word about those who are also making stuff".

That is why at the base of this experiment is the idea of spreading content, products and professionals that promote personal improvement and well-being.

<strong style="font-family: monospace;">What?</strong> We are a platform focused on personal growth, based on science and technology.

<strong style="font-family: monospace;">How?</strong> We create the concept of «appticles», articles with which it is possible to interact, just as you do with a normal application.

We create a <a title="Startup monitor" hreflang="es" href="https://alt.minimo.io/monitor/"><i class="fas fa-barcode"></i>&nbsp;Monitor</a> of startups, people and non-profits committed to well-being.

We create interactive and quality #longreads, with a scientific foundation in areas that promote personal well-being, such as physical and mental health, art and humor, nature and travel, and entrepreneurship and personal finance.

## The idea



At the base of the experiment is the idea of spreading content and products that promote personal improvement and well-being. ALT. therefore, has two arms of the same body or central idea.

<u>ON THE ONE HAND</u>, vaguely inspired by <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Product Hunt</a> we intend to create a Startups Monitor and products that seek to change for the better some part of reality. Cataloging both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Lab" target="_blank">B Companies</a>, social enterprises, or simply products that seek to solve specific problems, not based on ideological prejudices, but based on optimizing the search for the best possible solutions.

<u>ON THE OTHER HAND</u> we develop quality content whose concerns overlap with those solutions.
To achieve this we explore and investigate themes that meet the following conditions:

1. That search volumes and competition determine a positive impact potential of our effort.
2. That these concerns or questions have points of contact with the products or services cataloged in the Monitor, so that the whole thing allows us to match the problems to their solutions. And exploring the business potential that this means, make ALT. be sustainable.

In addition, content development has conditions of quality and style.

* We avoid disposable content. Instead, we are driven by the logic of [#longreads](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23longreads). Of generating quality content that keeps relevant over time.

* We place special emphasis on the care of aesthetics (based on Mínimo's the principles), as on the care of the quality of the content itself, with a good previous work in research and involvement with the issues.

* We avoid [intrusive advertising](https://minimo.io/en/2019/8/). We especially avoid "display" advertising, in the form of banners, popups, etc. That is why we created a [theme for Wordpress](https://minimo.io/2019/10-alt-wordpress-theme/) specially for the project, one with absolute focus on the content and released with a GPL v2 license.

## The business model

In general, the whole business model revolves around experimenting with the following challenge:

1. Investigate and find audiences looking for solutions to specific problems.
2. Generate quality content to satisfy and add value to those audiences.
3. Match those audiences and their problems with quality solutions from our Startups Monitor.

As said ALT. intends to match problems with quality solutions, focused on the niches of well-being, entrepreneurship and their associated lifestyles.

<br>

To continue with the analogy, the two arms of the body of the idea have different business potentials.

* <u>THE STARTUPS MONITOR</u>. It is the side that revolves around products reviews that are in tune with the themes of the core content. The business potential can be found in affiliate links, promoted or featured products, top picks, content marketing, beta-tester recruitment, presence and exposure in the newsletter or podcast, "sponsors" of the podcast, and in general services targeted to meet the needs of the startups or the developers that carry out the cataloged products. There are endless spin-offs and possibilities for content reuse, such as a podcast or monthly video-cast with interviews with the creators, video rankings, the creation of a Founders Club where investors can network with creators, etc.; providing the insight of ALT. regarding the needs of our audience. The general reference for this part of ALT. is the startup Product Hunt.

* <u>THE MAGAZINE</u>. The main purpose of the magazine is to generate audiences through on high quality content, and to match part of those audiences to the solutions of the Startups Monitor. The selection of content categories and themes will require a lot of experimentation. The original idea is not to make direct reviews of the products in the magazine (this is to be done in the Monitor, with a different logic), but to generate content based on topics related to them. For example, in the mega-post on "Anxiety disorders" there are different guided meditation solutions to mention, such as Headspace, Calm or Insight Timer, or to promote in case there is such option. In the case of promotional content, there is the possibility to promote local meditation centers or teachers.

## The roadmap

The above justifies the word "content". Now why a "laboratory"?

The obvious answer is that generating the kind of quality content we want is expensive. And generating a sustainable project based on that type of content can only be sustained with a logic of experimentation, measurement and course correction.

ALT. is implemented within minimo.io, since conceptually it is an extension of its [objectives and principles](https://minimo.io/en/manifest/).

The implementation of the idea with its business model will be carried out in stages.

* <u>VALIDATION STAGE</u>. The objective of this stage is to define if the idea has a business potential, with the minimal development possible, and regardless of profits. Therefore, there will be a special emphasis on testing ALT.'s potential to generate an audience and in the experimentation to create synergies between the two sides of the project.

* <u>DEVELOPMENT STAGE</u>. This stage deepens the development of all tools, with a focus on the Startup Monitor, such as:
  1. Development of the "Monitors" idea (people specialized in finding products, reviewing them, in exchange for a good part of the commission generated).
  2. Automatic distribution tools for entrepreneurs (such as products upload, payment of featured positions, promoted content, presence in podcasts or newsletters, answer to reviews and comments, etc.).
  3. Voting for subscribers.
  4. Special memberships to the magazine and access to premium content.
  5. Peer-reviews.
