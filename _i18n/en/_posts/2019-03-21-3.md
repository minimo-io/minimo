## The idea

Betizen appeals, through a viable [business model](#the-business-model), to be the online reference for Spanish and Portuguese speaking players; create "better citizens of the betting world" along the way, and promote quality affiliate businesses, with [focus](/en/manifest/#em-foco) on [long-term](/en/manifest/#em-largo-plazo) growth.

The betting world has always been a complicated place in itself. It brings together ethical issues, appetite for risk, impulse control, the concept of utility, entertainment, the expectation of easy money, and health.

On one hand betting have accompanied us since forever. It has bypassed legal and moral prohibitions, and yet the appeal that it means for many people to bet has not changed. It is stimulating and fun. But on the other hand it can also become a problem.

After six years working in the online gaming industry,
it was hard not to feel that something was wrong.

I understood after giving up my position, that I had two possibilities.

I could quit completely from an industry strongly focused on extraction, on predatory sites, on interruption-based marketing, on extracting from customers as much as possible regardless of the impact on their health.
Or I could do something about what bothered me.

I understood, after thinking for a while, that covering my eyes before the reality of gambling didn't contribute to anyone but myself.
I decided to act. Accept the experience I had acquired for better or worse, and with that knowledge about the reality of online betting, return, but this time to try to improve it.

That's how [Betizen](https://www.betizen.org) was born. Under the idea that the betting world, does not have to be a terrible or generally harmful place. But for it not to be, at least three conditions have to be met.

1. <u>First and foremost</u>: That players are well informed about which sites are fraudulent or have bad practices. That they can understand how bets work, and how the different machines and games of their choice work. That they can detect when their betting pattern turned from being an entertainment, to being a problem. That they can learn when to stop gambling, and if they can't, when to ask for help. That they also have the necessary information on where and how to request it.

2. <u>Second</u>: Stimulate that online casinos, meaning, the places where those who wish to bet go to play, have good policies, that are fair about payments and about their promotions offering. That they take care of people who are their clients and do not abuse those with gambling problems.

3. <u>Third</u>: That the machines on which players bet are not manipulated or tampered to pay less than what the developer reports. That they are transparent and consistent in their return values and their volatility. And that these values are accessible to players.

## The business model

In addition to having an instance [here](https://www.betizen.org), Betizen is a technological product. And therefore, its business models is developed under these two aspects, with 5 different modalities.

* <u>AFFILIATION</u>. It is the classic model of monetization of the niche, since as games are a digital product, casinos have a wider margin, compared for example, with retail affiliation (Amazon Associates). Despite this there is very little transparency and therefore abundance of "hidden fees" in commissions. Considering this Betizen will always prioritize <a href="https://www.betizen.org/visita/transparencia-en-agd/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">affiliate programs with fair fees</a> according to the Affiliates Guard Dog's list, those with acceptable commissions and better support from their AM.

* <u>JOINT-VENTURES by language</u>. We intend to create the best players community for Latin American users (in successive stages the possibility of expansion to other languages/markets will be analyzed), therefore the Spanish version is reserved under Mínimo's control. In this way we intend Spanish to serve as a model for the other languages and give overall consistency to the product. Other languages/markets will be joint-ventures under the following modality:

  * Mínimo will yield 90% of the profits of each languages/markets to its "Product Partners", in exchange for them to carry out the operation and content development, in coordination with Mínimo and in line with Betizen's goals. These "Product Partners" will have full access and control over affiliate links and reports of their language/market.

  * The "Product Partner" of each language/market will yield the remaining 10% of the joint-venture to Mínimo in exchange for the development, maintenance and constant improvement of the product. In this way, it is relieved of the costs of having to create and improve a platform, and instead of competing with a tough player, it will be a partner with Betizen in the common interest of creating the best casino community for LATAM. Mínimo will take care of software development according to a [public roadmap](#the-roadmap), in which each development cycle of the product will be traced by all Product Partners, Lead Partners and White Labels. Mínimo will also share profits of all these spin-off businesses, according to a scheme to be agreed on a case by case basis by each joint-venture.
