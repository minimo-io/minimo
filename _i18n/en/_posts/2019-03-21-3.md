## The idea

<div class="alert alert-warning text-center mt-4 mb-4" role="alert">
Our mission is to create the best support product for online players and the best technological product of conversion and marketing for iGaming affiliates.
</div>

Betizen appeals, through a [viable business model](#business-models), to be the online reference LATAM players (and in a second stage of other emerging markets/languages); create "better citizens of the betting world" along the way, and promote quality affiliate businesses, with focus on [long-term](/en/manifest/#em-largo-plazo) growth.

The betting world has always been a complicated place in itself. It brings together ethical issues, appetite for risk, impulse control, the concept of utility, entertainment, the expectation of easy money, and health.

On one hand betting has been with us since forever. It has bypassed legal and moral prohibitions, and yet the appeal that it means for many people to bet has not changed. It is stimulating and fun. But on the other hand it can also become a problem.

<!-- After six years working in the online gaming industry,
it was hard not to feel that something was wrong.

After giving up our position, we understood that we had two possibilities.

We could quit completely from an industry strongly focused on extraction, on predatory sites, on interruption-based marketing, on extracting from customers as much as possible regardless of the impact on their health,
or we could do something about it.

We understood, after reflecting for a while, that covering our eyes before the reality of gambling didn't contribute to anyone but ourselves.
We decided to act. To accept the experience we had acquired and with that knowledge about the reality of iGaming, return, but this time to try to improve it. -->

[Betizen](https://www.betizen.org) was born under the idea that the iGaming world, does not have to be a terrible or generally harmful place. But for it not be, at least three conditions have to be met.

1. <i class="bg-black text-uppercase">First</i>. That players are well informed about which sites are fraudulent or have bad practices. That they can understand how bets work, and how the different machines and games of their choice work. How licenses work. That they can detect when their betting pattern turned from being an entertainment, to being a problem. That they can learn when to stop gambling, and if they can't, when to ask for help. That they also have the necessary information on where and how to request it.

2. <i class="bg-black text-uppercase">Second</i>. Stimulate that online casinos, meaning, the places where those who wish to bet go to play, have good policies, that are fair about payments and about their promotional offering. That they take care of people who are their clients and do not abuse those with gambling problems.

3. <i class="bg-black text-uppercase">Third</i>. That the machines on which players place their bets are not manipulated or tampered to pay less than what the developer reports. That they are transparent and consistent in their return values and their volatility. And that these values are accessible to players.

<br>

## Business models

In addition to having an instance [here](https://www.betizen.org), Betizen is a technological product. And therefore, its business models is developed considering these two aspects: Affiliation and Product, with 5 different modalities.

* <i id="affiliation" class="bg-black text-uppercase">AFFILIATION</i>. It is the classic model of monetization of the niche. Since games are a digital product, casinos have a wider margin, compared for example, with retail affiliation (Amazon Associates). Despite this there is very little transparency and therefore abundance of "hidden fees" in commissions. Considering this, Betizen will catalog all platforms, always prioritizing <a href="https://www.betizen.org/visita/transparencia-en-agd/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">affiliate programs with fair fees</a> according to the Affiliates Guard Dog's list, those with acceptable commissions, better support from their AM, and with clear Terms and Conditions, both for end users and for affiliates.

* <i id="product-partners" class="bg-black text-uppercase">PRODUCT PARTNERS</i>. Our core mission is to create the best product to support LATAM players (and in the future players of other languages/emerging markets), and the best technological product, of marketing and conversion, for iGaming affiliates.
  <br>
  To fulfill that mission we need a deep knowledge of each local market.
  <br><br>
  To achieve this, we partner with local affiliates with experience in each language/market in order to create the best possible product, creating joint-ventures that provide us with the necessary knowledge of the language and the specific needs of their audiences.
  <br><br>
  Mínimo reserves the control of the Spanish version in order for it to serve as a model for the other languages and give overall consistency to the product. The other languages / markets will be joint-ventures where most of the profits will be transferred to our local partners, to be negotiated in a case to case basis, in exchange for the operation and content creation.
  <div class="alert alert-warning text-center mt-4 mb-4" role="alert"> If you know about affiliation and you are interested in participating as a majority partner if some emerging iGaming market <a href="{{site.whatsapp}}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">get in touch</a> in order to coordinate where to have a delicious <i class="fas fa-mug-hot"></i> together. </div>   

* <i id="lead-partners" class="bg-black text-uppercase">LEAD PARTNERS</i>. Betizen aims to be the reliable reference for online players, but it also aspires to be a technological product, fair and cheap for affiliates (only pay for what you use logic), one in which they can benefit from a quality product in constant improvement and optimization, without having to give part of their commissions or disperse efforts in developing themselves yet another expensive platform or mediocre site.
  <br><br>
  There are two ways to participate as a Lead Partner.
  <br><br>
  1. <i class="bg-black text-uppercase">CPA</i>. Send new users and earn a money for each. This value is automatically adjusted depending on the quality of your referrals. The more quality users the more money you make.
  2. <i class="bg-black text-uppercase">Partner</i>. Betizen will be yours for a fixed monthly cost starting at $ 17 and without commissions. That includes all outgoing links, in addition to having personalized analytics of your players and a lot of acquisition, conversion and transparency tools. The database belongs to the affiliate, and a prior [NDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement) with Mínimo is signed. We have no interest on making money from your users, but on expanding Betizen, and benefiting both users and affiliates, (and hence the iGaming industry as a whole) as much as possible.
  <br>
  All planned or developing features for Lead Partners are available on a public <a href="#the-roadmap">roadmap</a>.
  <br><br>
  Based on this business model, it is possible to create an Affiliate Club where we train (for free) our members, both in affiliation and in the use of the platform. In addition to coordinating marketing strategies that enhance mutual benefit, we create community, share experiences and promote synergies between affiliates.
  <br>
  <a role="button" href="https://www.betizen.org/affiliates/" class="btn btn-light d-block mt-2">Learn more about this program</a>
  <br>
* <i id="content-marketing" class="bg-black text-uppercase">CONTENT MARKETING</i>. While part of Betizen's transparency policy is that rankings and listings are fair and based on community contributions, there is room for content-marketing, highlights, access to the user notification system (infoups), etc. These agreements are welcome as long as they do not affect the quality of the product or its core mission. To have more bargaining power, these agreements are horizontal to all joint-ventures, so that both Product Partners and Lead Partners benefit from them.

## The roadmap

The “Roadmap” describes publicly for Product Partners, Lead Partners and for users in general the direction which Betizen's development is taking, the new features that are to come, those in which we are currently working, and bugs or errors reported. All Product Partners, Lead Partners and users can leave comments, and report new bugs.

As this is a very dynamic document (we are constantly working on the product) a single public access version (in Spanish) is maintained [here](https://www.notion.so/minimo/dc19261d862e4fc093033fe2c1945f2b?v=3d5a6e977d11476b94c49c0fbe4c0520).
