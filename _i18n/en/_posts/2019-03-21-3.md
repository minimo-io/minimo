The betting world has always been a complicated place in itself. It brings together ethical issues, appetite for risk, impulse control, the concept of utility, entertainment, the expectation of easy money, and health.

On one hand betting have accompanied us since forever. It has bypassed legal and moral prohibitions, and yet the appeal that it means for many people to bet has not changed. It is stimulating and fun. But on the other hand it can also become a problem.

After six years working in the online gaming industry,
it was hard not to feel that something was wrong.

I understood after giving up my position, that I had two possibilities.

I could quit completely from an industry strongly focused on extraction, on predatory sites, on interruption-based marketing, on extracting from customers as much as possible regardless of the impact on their health.
Or I could do something about what bothered me.

I understood, after thinking for a while, that covering my eyes before the reality of gambling didn't contribute to anyone but myself.
I decided to act. Accept the experience I had acquired for better or worse, and with that knowledge about the reality of online betting, return, but this time to try to improve it.

That's how Betizen was born. Under the idea that the betting world, if it is going to exist, does not have to be a terrible place. But for it not to be, at least three conditions have to be met.

1. <u>First and foremost</u>: That players are well informed about which sites are fraudulent or have bad practices. That they can understand how bets work, and how the different machines and games of their choice work. That they can detect when their betting pattern turned from being an entertainment, to being a problem. That they can learn when to stop gambling, and if they can't, when to ask for help. That they also have the necessary information on where and how to request it.

2. <u>Second</u>: Stimulate that online casinos, meaning, the places where those who wish to bet go to play, have good policies, that are fair about payments and about their promotions offering. That they take care of people who are their clients and do not abuse those with gambling problems.

3. <u>Third</u>: That the machines on which players bet are not manipulated or tampered to pay less than what the developer reports. That they are transparent and consistent in their return values and their volatility. And that these values are accessible to players.

That said, we present Betizen, the first Latin American online gaming community with fair and auditable rankings based on client's reviews, focus on users health and control of the casinos. A project that appeals to create "better citizens of the gambling world”.
