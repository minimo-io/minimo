Betizen is the first LATAM iGaming community with auditable rankings based on client's reviews, focus in fairness and the control of the casinos.

## The idea

Betizen appeals, through a [viable business model](#the-business-model), to be the online reference for Spanish and Portuguese speaking players; create "better citizens of the betting world" along the way, and promote quality affiliate businesses, with [focus](/en/manifest/#em-foco) on [long-term](/en/manifest/#em-largo-plazo) growth.

The betting world has always been a complicated place in itself. It brings together ethical issues, appetite for risk, impulse control, the concept of utility, entertainment, the expectation of easy money, and health.

On one hand betting has been with us since forever. It has bypassed legal and moral prohibitions, and yet the appeal that it means for many people to bet has not changed. It is stimulating and fun. But on the other hand it can also become a problem.

After six years working in the online gaming industry,
it was hard not to feel that something was wrong.

After giving up my position, I understood that I had two possibilities.

I could quit completely from an industry strongly focused on extraction, on predatory sites, on interruption-based marketing, on extracting from customers as much as possible regardless of the impact on their health.
Or I could do something about what bothered me.

I understood, after thinking for a while, that covering my eyes before the reality of gambling didn't contribute to anyone but myself.
I decided to act. Accept the experience I had acquired for better or worse, and with that knowledge about the reality of online betting, return, but this time to try to improve it.

That's how [Betizen](https://www.betizen.org) was born. Under the idea that the betting world, does not have to be a terrible or generally harmful place. But for it not to be, at least three conditions have to be met.

1. <u>First and foremost</u>: That players are well informed about which sites are fraudulent or have bad practices. That they can understand how bets work, and how the different machines and games of their choice work. How licenses work. That they can detect when their betting pattern turned from being an entertainment, to being a problem. That they can learn when to stop gambling, and if they can't, when to ask for help. That they also have the necessary information on where and how to request it.

2. <u>Second</u>: Stimulate that online casinos, meaning, the places where those who wish to bet go to play, have good policies, that are fair about payments and about their promotional offering. That they take care of people who are their clients and do not abuse those with gambling problems.

3. <u>Third</u>: That the machines on which players place their bets are not manipulated or tampered to pay less than what the developer reports. That they are transparent and consistent in their return values and their volatility. And that these values are accessible to players.

## The business model

In addition to having an instance [here](https://www.betizen.org), Betizen is a technological product. And therefore, its business models is developed considering these two aspects, with 5 different modalities.

* <u>AFFILIATION</u>. It is the classic model of monetization of the niche. Since games are a digital product, casinos have a wider margin, compared for example, with retail affiliation (Amazon Associates). Despite this there is very little transparency and therefore abundance of "hidden fees" in commissions. Considering this Betizen will always prioritize <a href="https://www.betizen.org/visita/transparencia-en-agd/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">affiliate programs with fair fees</a> according to the Affiliates Guard Dog's list, those with acceptable commissions and better support from their AM.

* <u>JOINT-VENTURES by language</u>. We intend to create the best players community for Latin American users (in successive stages the possibility of expansion to other languages/markets will be analyzed), therefore the Spanish version is reserved under Mínimo's control. In this way we intend Spanish to serve as a model for the other languages and give overall consistency to the product. Other languages/markets will be joint-ventures under the following modality:

  * Mínimo will yield 90% of the profits of each languages/markets to its Product Partners, in exchange for them to carry out the operation and content development, in coordination with Mínimo and in line with Betizen's core mission. These Product Partners will have full access and control over affiliate links and reports of their language/market.

  * The Product Partner of each language/market will yield the remaining 10% of the joint-venture to Mínimo in exchange for the development, maintenance and constant improvement of the product. In this way, it is relieved of the costs of having to create and improve a platform, and instead of competing with a tough player, it will be a partner with Betizen in the common interest of creating the best casino community for LATAM. Mínimo will take care of software development and sysadmin according to a [public roadmap](#the-roadmap), in which each development cycle of the product will be traced by all Product Partners, Lead Partners and White Labels. Mínimo will also share profits of all these spin-off businesses, according to a scheme to be agreed on a case by case basis by each joint-venture.

* <u>LEAD PARTNERS</u>. Betizen aims to be the reliable reference for online players, but also aspires to be a community in which other affiliates can benefit from a quality product in constant improvement and optimization, without having to disperse efforts in developing themselves yet another expensive platform or mediocre sites.
<br><br>At the base of this idea is the possibility that the affiliates, prior agreement and registration, refer "leads". In doing so, all monetizable links and boxes on the site, for that player referred, become a 100% controller by the affiliate. That is, for a cost of between 5% to 10%, with maximum caps, the casino affiliate of any language/market, not only has a high quality conversion platform at his disposal, but also reduces software development costs, content creation costs, and operational costs, plus uses an already optimized platform, in constant improvement and growth, being able to focus entirely on acquisition. For this to work, transparency tools of the base product are vital, so that affiliates have security and control, and can audit their "leads", their affiliate links, etc. <br> <br> Based on this business model, it is possible to create an Affiliate Club where we train our members for free, both in affiliation and in the use of the platform. In addition to coordinating marketing strategies that enhance mutual benefit, we create community, share experiences and foster synergies among affiliates.

* <u>CONTENT MARKETING</u>. While part of Betizen's transparency policy is that rankings and listings are fair and based on community contributions, there is room for content-marketing, highlights, access to the user notification system (infoups), etc. These agreements are welcome as long as they do not affect the quality of the product or its core mission. To have more bargaining power, these agreements are horizontal to all joint-ventures, so that both Product Partners and Lead Partners benefit from them.

* <u>WHITE-LABELS</u>. Besides having an implementation [here](https://www.betizen.org), Betizen really is a technological asset, with the aspiration to become the best affiliate community product for gambling users and casinos, based on [Minimo's Development Principles](https://minimo.io/en/manifest/#principios). This way the business possibility of selling the software as a service opens up with customized implementations, setup and training, custom features, and more, targeted towards large affiliates who can benefit from a software with a solid mission and roadmap, one in constant improvement and expansion, with the same functionalities of a successful the parent site.

## The roadmap

The “Roadmap” describes publicly for Product Partners, Lead Partners, White Labels, and for users in general the direction which Betizen's development is taking, the new features that are to come, those in which we are currently working, and bugs or errors reported. All Product Partners, Lead Partners, White Labels and users can leave comments, and report new bugs.

As this is a very dynamic document (we are constantly working on the product) a single public access version (in Spanish) is maintained [here](https://www.notion.so/minimo/dc19261d862e4fc093033fe2c1945f2b?v=3d5a6e977d11476b94c49c0fbe4c0520).
