After six years of working in the online gaming industry as an affiliate, and of a period in which it was difficult not to lose hope that things could work differently, I understood that there were two possibilities.

Or I made the choice to withdraw completely from an industry focused exclusively on extraction, on predatory sites, on marketing based on interruption, on hindering the client's experience in order to extract from them as much as possible,
regardless of the impact on their health with the few exceptions of some politically correct comments in conferences and in the necessary footnotes. Operating using suspicious practices, with arbitrary and suspicious paying, under suspicious licenses, and with fraudulent information.

I could write a article to purge the displeasure by reporting the internals,
denouncing enemies, and revealing interdicts of a world that at times is fascinating and some other times recalls scenes of a "Wolf of Walstreet" devalued by third world realities.

Or I could appropriate that experience, and use what I have learned and some chips of indignation to try to contribute something positive to an industry that desperately needs it.

That is why, in the attempt to not ignore what we have to do, Mínimo proposes to bring some hope.

We present Betizen, the first Latin American online gaming community with auditable rankings, focus on user health and control of casinos, a project under development that appeals to create good "citizens of the online betting world".
