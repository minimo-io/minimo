## What do we do?
Hopmasters aims to promote craft beer culture around the world.
To achieve that goal we create different tools:

* A <i class="fas fa-shopping-cart mr-1"></i>Store open to brewers and microbreweries so they can promote and sell their products at a fair price, without having to take care of the technological side of it.
* <i class="fas fa-medal mr-1"></i>Rankings of beers by country, based on the opinions of the community, so that users can vote, discuss and buy their favorite beers + receive news about their favorite breweries.
* A <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap mr-1"></i>School for new brewers to learn how to make their own craft beer alongside qualified master brewers, with proven recipes and methods, and through the exchange with community members.

## Why do we do it?
Alongside with homebrewers and microbreweries grows a community of enthusiasts.

One that favors local economies through the consumption of beer created with a passion for the product itself. One that experiments with new flavors and processes, and one which shares back because it knows that its strength and energy lies in doing so, while increasing the diversity and quality of the general offer.

This is the community that Hopmasters wants to serve with quality tools and information that respects the principles that make more and more people decide for craft beer.

## Who are we?
A bunch of drunks with programming skills <i class="fas fa-grin-beam-sweat"></i>

Actually, Hopmasters was developed by <a href="https://minimo.io"><i class="fas fa-circle mr-1" style="color:black;"></i>MÃ­nimo</a>, a digital ideas lab based in Uruguay, with the initiative of contributing to the strengthening of the craft beer community.
