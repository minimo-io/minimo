ALT. is a Bootstrap-based template that works as the visual base for MÃ­nimo's in-house projects.

It has an [HTML](https://github.com/minimo-io/alt-template) and a [Wordpress](https://github.com/minimo-io/alt-wordpress-theme) version, a free license, a minimalist inspiration and absolute focus on content.

Its purposes are:

1. Give an overall design consistency to all products in the lab.
2. Maintain a minimalist philosophy, focused on content.
3. To be a versatile and easily extensible template that adapts to the specific needs of each of the products.
4. Accelerate the speed of product prototyping.

We set out to create a template that would get out of the way. One that avoids the temptation to interrupt the reader on its access to content.
An adaptable, mobile-first interface that allows a beautiful reading experience. A theme with the indispensable elements that would prioritize the beauty of images and typography, and at the same time flexible enough to fulfill a variety of functions, such as video and audio display, featured images, both in complex communities and simple blogging sites.

ALT. is an open source project, available at [Github](https://github.com/minimo-io/alt-template) for its free use. And has a [public roadmap](https://www.notion.so/minimo/3e1975e420e749618d263dcadc41411b?v=bec9c08c1461402fb51d5ed440a378b9) (in Spanish).
