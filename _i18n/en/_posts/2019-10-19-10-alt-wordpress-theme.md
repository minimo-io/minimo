Looking for a Wordpress theme for the <a href="https://alt.minimo.io" target="_blank">ALT. project</a> we realize there was no template in tune with MÃ­nimo's design principles.

Inspired by what we consider to be some of the most notable digital magazines, we decided to create "Alt", a Wordpress theme with a free license, and an absolute focus on content.

We set out to create a template that would get out of the way. One that avoids the temptation to interrupt the reader on its access to content.
An adaptable interface for both desktop and mobile that allows a beautiful reading experience. A theme with the indispensable elements that would prioritize the beauty of images and typography, and at the same time flexible enough to fulfill a variety of functions, such as video and audio display, featured images, etc.

With that in mind we began this 0.5 version of the <u>Alt Wordpress theme</u>. Available on Github and in the Wordpress repository.
