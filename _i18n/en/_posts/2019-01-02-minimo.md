Mínimo is a laboratory of digital ideas.

An enterprise that generates and provides the resources for its associated creators to explore ideas: with a design philosophy, a work ethic, and a specific business logic ([see]({% tl manifest%})).

Mínimo has a technology arm (Lab) and a creative arm (Studio) that provide the technical and artistic resources
respectively, for all the "Hub" projects.

<br>

## The business model

Mínimo has its own projects, and also has associated projects and creators.
It is a "hub" that generates and distributes dividends from all projects among all its associated creators.
And as a "hub" it's also a place to share experiences and skills among entrepreneurs.

For a project to be financed and developed within Mínimo's structure
it needs to be aligned with the [Mínimo's Principles]({% tl manifest%}),
 must have the potential to be at least self-sustaining, and must involve an improvement, an innovation or a contribution
to the niche where it is directed.

## The theme

Mínimo was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), based on the minimalist template [Thinkspace] (https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace) from @heiswayi.

We asked ourselves:
What is the minimum amount of resources to use to tell what we need
tell? What is the exact minimum for the message to arrive without interference?

The result is this multi-language Mínimo theme for Jekyll, [available on Github](https://github.com/minimo-io/minimo) to use for free <i class = "fas fa-hand-rock" > </i> Which is the basis of this site.
